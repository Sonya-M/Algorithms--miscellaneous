# Algorithms--miscellaneous

Various exercises in Java and JS.

The code is mostly based on the implementations presented in Princeton's Algorithms course on Coursera.

To comply with Coursera Honor Code, I have kept the code for the actual assignments private. Still, those are the projects I am most proud of. If you are interested, I would be more than happy to share those on request, or add you as a collaborator on the private repo.
